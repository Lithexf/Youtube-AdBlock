# Youtube Adblock + DeBlock for new YT Premium popup

**Status:** Pre-Alpha. V1, based on the test i did totally usable, but i can foresee some bugs
## The combined and improved script from "yellonolo" and "iamfugui" 

## Recommended addons (this script doesnt block every AD)
- Install the add-on called: Decentraleyes
- Install the add-on called: UblockOrigin
- Install the add-on called: Ninja-cookie

## for UblockOrigin:
- download the addon
- click settings
- scroll down
- repair from file (or "setup from file" depending on language. Either way, its the 2nd to last button)
- download the file called "ublocksetup" in this repo
- and whenever you are promted to select a ublock setting file use that "ublocksetup"
- then you are done, that config file wil automatically set everything to ad-less but usuable

## Setup:
Download Tampermonkey script manager, click the add-on, click "Add New Scrip +", it opens a new document, ctrl + A delete everything to have an empty window.
And, copy and paste the code found in the adblocker.js.
